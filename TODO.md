# Repository changes
* Convert README to markdown

# Sources of problems
## Large / Recurring
* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
* [Reddit: Daily Programmer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer)
## Other / one-off
* The algorithmic challenges described in [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/3rb88w/ten_questions_ive_been_asked_most_more_than_once/)

# Efficiency
* project_euler/005.js - Spending a few cycles to find the largest prime factors of max_divisor would eliminate the need to test for those.
* project_eulser/007.js - Replace brute forced prime generator with more efficient prime generating algorithm.
* project_euler/010.js - Further evidence of the need for a more efficient prime generation algorithm.
