This repository contains solutions to various coding problems found around the internet. Large sources of such problems will have their own directories. All others will be left in the unsorted directory until their source becomes large enough to warrant its own directory.

The includes directory will contain frequently reused code such as prime number generators. For languages that do not use an include-like functionality, code will be stored in this directory to be pasted into new solutions where necessary.

TODO contains problems that look interesting that I have not yet committed a solution to. TODO will also contain things to do with the organization of this repo.

To submit a problem source or problem, feel free to contact me or to submit a pull request that includes modifications to TODO.md .
